## K-Means Clustering from scratch
This folder contains the implmentation of the k-means clustering algortihm from scratch .<br>

K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning model that is usually used on datasets where there is no information about the dependent variable.The aim of this algorithm is to identify clusters in the data and thus provide a structure for further research about the groups.<br>

From the cluster, we can extract information about the behavior of data , make predictions about unknown data points or implement a supervised model on top of the clustering data.
