The goal is to first use data-driven models for predicting what is more likely to happen in the future, and then use modern
optimization methods to search for the best possible solution given what can be currently known and predicted.

Popularity is often measured by considering the number of interactions in the Web and social networks (e.g., number of
shares, likes and comments). Predicting such popularity is valuable for authors,content providers,
advertisers and even activists/politicians (e.g., to understand or influence public opinion).

This folder contains a dataset and a python file classifying a  particular news as popular or unpopular.
Although the accuracy is low, experimentation  with the model is highly advisable.
