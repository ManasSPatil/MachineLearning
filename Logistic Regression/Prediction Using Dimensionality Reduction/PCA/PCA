Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations
of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.
This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance
(that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible),
and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. 
The resulting vectors (each being a linear combination of the variables and containing n observations) are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables.

In this folder we have an implementation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) done to reduce the dimensions of a dataset and predict 
the outcome of a  logistic regression based classification model.The folder contains a python file and a dataset .
