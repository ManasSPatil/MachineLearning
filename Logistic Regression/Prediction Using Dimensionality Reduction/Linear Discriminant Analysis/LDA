Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a dimensionality reduction technique.
As the name implies dimensionality reduction techniques reduce the number of dimensions (i.e. variables) in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. 

In this folder we have an implementation of the Linear Discriminant  Analysis (LDA) done to reduce the dimensions of a dataset and predict 
the outcome of a  logistic regression based classification model.The folder contains a python file and a dataset .
