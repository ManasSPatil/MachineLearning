# PUBG Final Placement Prediction

This folder contains a solution to  the  <b>PUBG Final Placement Prediction Challenge</b> presented on Kaggle .The approach taken uses pipelines which preprocess and predict the output of the proposed problem.<br>The problem statement is as follows:</br>
> You are given over 65,000 games' worth of anonymized player data, split into training and testing sets, and asked to predict final placement from final in-game stats and initial player ratings.What's the best strategy to win in PUBG? Should you sit in one spot and hide your way into victory, or do you need to be the top shot? Let's let the data do the talking!

Looking  at the dataset we observe that this is primarily a regression problem , so the proposed solution involves using RandomForest Regression or other similar models to predict the output for the target variable. <br>
