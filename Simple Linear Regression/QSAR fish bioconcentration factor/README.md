# QSAR fish bio-concentration factor 
This project is a simple implementation of linear regression used for the prediction of a dependent variable. The dataset can be found on: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/QSAR+fish+bioconcentration+factor+%28BCF%29 

The  dataset used contains manually-curated experimental bioconcentration factor (BCF) for 1058 molecules (continuous values). Each row contains a molecule, identified by a CAS number, a name (if available), and a SMILES string. Additionally, the KOW (experimental or predicted) is reported. In this database, you will also find Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (binary vectors of 1024 bits), to be used as independent variables to predict the BCF.

The folder also contains a pdf file which gives directions and operations to be applied on the dataset.
