The following folder contains the implmentation of Support Vector Machine from scratch .Support Vector Machines are a great way to classify
data into groups and make predictions . A support vector machine is based on the convex optimisation problem and a huge part of the code 
implmentation contains optimising the values of the parameters 'w' and 'b'.
